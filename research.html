        Why This Will Work
      </h1>
      <p style="color: #444" data-i18n="research.paragraphOne">
        The sound of your cough and breathing has long been
         utilized by medical professionals as a judgement of respiratory health
         and for diagnosis of various diseases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic,
         medical personnel would collect these sounds from a patient and
         subsequently make a diagnosis through in-person office visits.
         Although this previously common diagnostic method saves both time and
         money, the feasibility of an in-person diagnosis of COVID-19 through a
         patient’s cough and breathing is almost null due to the essentiality
         of social distancing and limitation of medical personnel during this
         pandemic.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #444" data-i18n="research.paragraphTwo">
         However, with the spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diagnostic
         technology, it may be possible to diagnose COVID-19 through a simple
         recording of a cough into a smartphone app. Due to the ability of AI
         algorithms to pick up on minute - yet still distinguishable - patterns
         in audio features, AI has been able to exhibit high sensitivity and
         specificity in classifying respiratory diseases [1,2,3,4,5].
         Previous examples of successful AI diagnostic models include those
         that diagnose wheezing and rhonchi [10], pertussis [3], asthma [1],
          and pneumonia [1] - all of which utilized
         the unique respiratory signature of each disease to differentiate
         positive cases.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #444" data-i18n="research.paragraphThree">
         Similar to all other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 creates a unique
         respiratory signature in the throat and lungs that is distinct from
         other respiratory infections that produce a wet cough. Consequently,
         it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect
         COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several
         prestigious institutions, including CMU[8],
         MIT [11], and Cambridge [7].
         For example, a crowdsource research done by University
         of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier
         is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and
         coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7) [7].
         Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that
         distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained a model to diagnose
         COVID-19 with a 89.1% accuracy [8]
      </p>
       <p style="color: #444" data-i18n="research.paragraphFour">
         Based on this past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that
         can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes
         based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous
         COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims
         to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run
         initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is
         developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial
         inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and
         community-specific phonological differences.
       </p>
       <p style="color: #444" data-i18n="research.paragraphFive">
         Currently, Virufy has developed a model with an 85% accuracy with
         clinical data derived from several countries and spanning multiple
         ethnicities. However, while our model is of high accuracy, we
         recognize that this is not enough. We need your cough in order to
         refine our model and ultimately develop a free COVID-19 diagnostic
         model that can easily and instantly provide a COVID-19 diagnosis
         through a smartphone application.
       </p>

      <p data-i18n="research.projectOne">
        A crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge that used cough
        samples and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19 sounds
        are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Their results show that
        even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify
        correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. Our models achieve an AUC above
        70% across all tasks. This work inspires further investigation of how
        automatically analyzed respiratory patterns could be used as
        pre-screening signals to aid COVID-19 diagnosis [7].

      <p data-i18n="research.projectTwo">
        A study by Carnegie Mellon University aimed to collect a large number
        of voice samples to train AI for diagnosis of COVID. The rationale
        behind the study is that, "the sound of our voice (regardless of
        language), and the sounds we make when we breathe or cough change
        when our respiratory system is affected.
        The changes range from coarse, clearly audible changes, to minute
        changes -- what we call "micro" signatures, that are not audible to the
        untrained listener, but are nevertheless present" [8].
